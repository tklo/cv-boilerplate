    description:
      "* One of our most challenging projects at CERN BE-CO-IN section was to design and implement
      the Proof of Concept platform that could replace the former legacy service management solution,
      while keeping the interface and release-deploy-configure workflow for users backward compatible.
      The platform consisted of Python and Ansible-based tool for deployment of the accelerators controls applications,
      adding/removing the services to/from an applications database (to make them persistent across installations),
      and generating configuration for service monitoring and management (based on monit).
      Additionally, we provided a consistent solution for supplying the user specific checks for a service or group of services."

    description:
      "* My responsibilities in the project have been mostly related to the transformation of an old bash/awk/Python script-based
      configuration management to a modern Ansible-based solution. One of the main goals of the project was to replace
      inconsistent (and in some cases non-existing) version controlling systems of various parts of system configuration with a single git tree.

      * Some of the most interesting challenges I have faced included developing Ansible playbooks for:\\\

      ** converting Python-based variable database into a set of Ansible variables\\\

      ** converting specific sudo and SSH configuration for all machines\\\

      ** implementing a filesystem monitoring system based on auditd, rsyslog, Elasticsearch, Logalike and Kibana (dashboards)\\\

      ** massive analysis, comparison, fixing errors and making more consistent of kickstart files for all 2000+ machines (included also changes in PXE servers and generating kickstart files based on Ansible inventory file and CERN's internal sources of data about hosts)\\\

      ** creating monit configuration for process management and monitoring."

      ** preparation of the operation systems for the smooth clusters operation\\\

      ** upgrade to ES 2.0 and Kibana 4\\\

      ** creation of nginx reverse proxy configuration\\\

      ** creation of monit configuration and checks for all ELK services\\\

      combined into consistent chain of jobs (and eventual rollbacks) in Jenkins.
      My responsibilities in the project included maintenance of the crucial services: Jenkins, GitLab.
      I have developed also multitude of mostly bash (and sometimes Python) scripts. I have managed also our git repositories.
      For building RPM packages we have used set of open source tools (mostly from Fedora Project):
      koji, mock, mash/createrepo, revisor/pungi, Sigul.
      Our testing environment was based on Vagrant, Packer, RHEV's virtual machines spawned during
      the testing phase and removed after it success or failure. We have monitored all services using Zabbix."

    description:
      "(1) In the very early stage of its development, I've worked on establishing and maintenance a (Ubuntu Server and KVM-based)
      OpenStack 12-nodes cluster integrated with a GlusterFS cluster (as a replacement for NFS for instance migration between nodes).
      Installation and configuration of the machines had been automated with Opscode Chef.
      I have really enjoyed it, although at that time it was too early for adoption for OpenStack in production.
      Similar deployment has been prepared by me also for Eucalyptus cloud (except the OS difference: in this project I have used CentOS).\\\

      (2) Successful evaluation of Chef as a DevOps configuration management tool, resulted in adoption of it in of our clients project.
      I have written a chef cookbook for automatic orchestration of development and testing environment of Java web application
      run on Apache Tomcat and using Oracle XE 11g. It was an application for one of the biggest Polish insurance companies.\\\

      (3) Finally, I have worked on few Proof of Concept projects evaluating Cloudera Hadoop.
      I was responsible for installation, configuration (using Chef) and maintenance of the cluster and additional tools.
      The projects outcome was a set of MapReduce jobs (written in Java) and deployed on 20 nodes Hadoop cluster,
      operating on 10TB of data. Additionally, we have used Flume for integration with Twitter API.
      MR Job's configuration was managed with Oozie.
      I've also integrated R Statistical Language with the cluster and I have written dozens of shell scripts for file manipulations on HDFS. "
